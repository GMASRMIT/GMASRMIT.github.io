Welcome to the GMAS website!

This is a simple "front page" of gmas which includes links to socials, sponsor details, membership card and signup details.
It also hosts the page that the QR codes on the back of our memebership cards redirect to.

**IMPORTANT: CHANGING URLS / PAGE PATHS**
-
The memebership cards and banners have QR codes.
These QR codes can be dynamically reset to different URLS using the http://rebrandly.com/ service.

Any changes to URLs that are referred to by QRs out there in the world MUST be updated in rebrandly.
If not, all QR codes across all membership cards will 404 or direct to the wrong page.

**Request to update rebrandly first before going live with a commit that changes URL structure.**
